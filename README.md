## 📊 Key Insights

1. **Workforce Distribution**  
   - The Sales and IT departments have the highest number of employees.  
   - Some departments are noticeably under-represented, possibly indicating understaffing or niche roles.

2. **Attrition Patterns**  
   - Younger employees and those with lower satisfaction scores are more likely to leave.  
   - Environment and job satisfaction strongly correlate with attrition risk.

3. **Performance and Promotion**  
   - High-performing employees often have longer tenures and are more likely to be promoted.  
   - A few top performers lack promotion history, suggesting possible oversight in talent management.

4. **Salary and Job Level**  
   - Salary increases with job level as expected, but there are discrepancies across similar roles.  
   - Unequal pay for similar job titles may hint at pay equity issues.
